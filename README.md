# 📝 main.ipynb - PCA Implementation  

This Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) contains an implementation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. It includes:  

- Data preprocessing steps  
- Applying PCA using Python  
- Visualizing the results  
- Explanation of how PCA works  

If you're interested in learning more about PCA, I have written a **Medium blog** on this topic.
